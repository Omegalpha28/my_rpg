/// On a pale blue dot, somewhere in the observable universe
/// lives an extraordinary creature known locally as the axolotl.
/// These aquatic salamanders live a free and peaceful life
/// and with their bellies full, and no natural predators in sight, it's
/// easy to rest by the warmth of the campfire.
/// However, letting your guard down can come at great cost...
/// ...
/// This axolotl has slept through the entire incident.
/// With little time to think about their lost children, their sole
/// motivation is the desire to feed.
/// A full axolotl is a happy axolotl.
/// O-oh dear!
/// Axolotls can excuse stolen children, but they draw the line at
/// stealing food.
/// Someone is about to get f**** up.
