- A collision system including moving and static elements with different shapes.
- A simple particule system that can display at least 2 types of particles.
- Particle effects (changing colors, scaling, boucing, fading) to simulate realistic environment (wind, fire, rain, snow...).
- Camera movements (zoom, translation, rotation).
- 3D effects (depth scaling, isometric projection...)

### MUST

> [!CAUTION]
> The size of your repository (including the assets) must be as small as possible. Think of the format and the encoding of your resource files (sounds, music, images,...). An average maximal size might be 30MB, all included. Any repository exceeding this limit might not be evaluated at all.
